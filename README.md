# pLAST

**pLAST** is a computational tool for rapid comparison and classification of plasmid sequences based on their **ORF composition**.  

It supports:

- Similarity search against plasmid databases using a single query  
- Clustering of large plasmid datasets  
- Fast and scalable comparative analysis  

---

# 🌐 pLAST Web Interface

The online pLAST server is available here:  
👉 [https://plast.lbs.cent.uw.edu.pl/](https://plast.lbs.cent.uw.edu.pl/)  

It provides a convenient graphical interface for running searches and visualizing results without installing the software locally.

---

# 🛠️ Installation

### Basic installation
pLAST requires Python version 3.9 to 3.12. You can install pLAST directly using:

```bash
pip install plast
```
